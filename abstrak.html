        <h2>Integrated project: Penidaâ€™s Point Of View</h2>
        <p>

            Abstract
<br><br>
            In Saint Ursula Jakarta School, every grade has a project called ILP, which stands for Integrated Learning
            Project, according to the dictionary, ILP means a dynamic approach to education that allows students to
            discover content, engage higher thinking skills, and make personal connections. Penidaâ€™s Wave was named by
            my group and me. We chose the name Penidaâ€™s Wave because we would like to go for a Bali theme. We surfed
            through the internet to find some beach names in Bali until we found one matching our team. Each grade has a
            different project to do every year. Luckily for grade 9, we got a project to hold a bazaar. <br><br>

            Working on this project with Penidaâ€™s Wave has been such an unforgettable experience. From the beginning, we
            faced a lot of challenges, but in the end, we learned so much. Obstacles were faced, especially when trying
            to manage time between school, this project, and personal life. It was then we realized that teamwork takes
            patience and good communication between each of us. A lot of adjustments were made whenever our ideas
            clashed and sometimes mistakes happened because of it. Miscommunication was spotted, especially when
            planning tasks, but we always found a way out of things together. Efforts and sweat were put in to keep
            everyone motivated, especially when things got stressful. <br><br>

            Preparing for the selling day was not as easy as we expected, from choosing what to sell, buying materials,
            making the products, and finally setting up the booth. Despite all that, we created stronger bonds, and we
            had so much fun working together. New skills were unlocked, especially in marketing, handling customers,
            making handmade products, and problem-solving. A sense of achievement was felt every time someone bought our
            products. Besides managing time and teamwork, personal growth was experienced in learning how to handle
            pressure and adapt to unexpected situations. It was discovered that problem,-solving was developed,
            especially when decorating our booth and finding a way to make our products stand out. A lot of support was
            given and received from our friends and family who bought our products, and everyone help each other
            whenever someone was struggling. <br><br>

            Another exciting part of the project was organizing our musical show collaboration with Cartara to bring
            enlighten our school show. Leadership skills were encouraged as we had to divide responsibilities and make
            sure everything ran smoothly. An appreciation for teamwork was strengthened since every little task
            contributed to the overall success. Friends, teachers, fand amilies were there, helping us improve our
            products and selling strategies. Decision-making was practiced, making sure fair-priced and quality
            products. We also managed online and offline orders, ensuring customers received their products/orders on
            time. <br><br>
            This project was not just about selling things but also creativity was poured into the making of this
            project. Boot decorating was planned carefully, making sure it was eye-catching and represented our group
            well. From choosing what to sell to setting up on the final selling day, every step of the process was
            experienced firsthand, and it gave us a deeper appreciation. Excitement was felt whenever we saw customers
            enjoying our products, making all the hard work paid off.
            In the end, pride was taken in everything we accomplished, and the lessons we learned will be useful in the
            future.
